\section{Conclusion}
\begin{multicols}{2}
To conclude, I have presented a protocol for peer to peer search and
indexing of BitTorrent infohashes. As of now, it is functional and I have a
working implementation (https://github.com/dfi/dfi). 
DFI allows for nodes to leave and join at any time, and is resilient to
censorship. Provided that a node has at least one connection to one node in
the main network, it can still retain full network awareness. This full
awareness is important as it allows address resolution to occur quickly, and
minimises loss of information.
I have not attempted to implement my own file transfer protocol: simply improve
upon the indexing and discovery of files. The DFI protocol allows for this to be
done in a decentralised manner, which allows for maximal sharing.
