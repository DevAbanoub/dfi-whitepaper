\section{Future}

This is not the final specification for DFI, and in the future I would like to
add a few other features. 

For one, I would like to allow for seeds to answer remote search queries on
behalf of the original author. This would require some sort of seed ``promotion"
by the author, and could perhaps be done by some sort of friend system. A new
list may have to be added to the \texttt{Entry}, detailing those the \texttt{Entry} trusts to
answer queries on its behalf.

I would also like to allow for more file transfer protocols than just
BitTorrent. This could be done by specifying some sort of Content-Type in posts,
or a field in meta.

Another possible adjustment is culling of the NetDB. If DFI grows to be large,
then there could be possible storage issues, where storing all known nodes
becomes too many. A possible solution is removing any peer that has no content
and has been inactive for a long time.

Finally, I would like to allow for user-submitted data --- for instance, something
like comments. This could be done in a similar manner to seed discovery. The
only issues I can see here are those of spam, and any sort of user verification
- UseNet has a similar issue with spam \cite{spam}. Sadly the best option 
here is some sort of hosted and centralised database for comments, as these
are not essential to the network's functionality.
